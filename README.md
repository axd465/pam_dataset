# The Duke PAM Dataset

Duke PAM is a photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) dataset collected at Duke University
with the optical resolution PAM (OR-PAM) system described in (M. Chen et al.,
"Simultaneous photoacoustic imaging of intravascular and tissue oxygenation,"
Optics Letters, vol. 44, no. 15, pp. 3773-3776, 2019.) at a wavelength of 532 nm.
This dataset is composed of primarily mouse brain microvasculature images, with
a few images of mouse ear and tumors. Although collected in 3-D, for the purposes
of viewing, collection, and storage, the images have been projected into 2-D
using maximum amplitude projection (MAP). These data were collected with support
from the National Institutes of Health (R01 EB028143, R01 NS111039, R01 NS115581,
R21 EB027304, R43 CA243822, R43 CA239830, R44 HL138185); Duke MEDx Basic Science
Grant; Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology Faculty Research Grant;
Duke Institute of Brain Science Incubator Award; American Heart Association
Collaborative Sciences Award (18CSA34080277).
